# Batch merge path sort

**Authors :** Thomas Jacquot - Simon Demouchy

**Description :** As part of the *GPU Programming course* at ENSAE Paris, students were required to build a project using CUDA. The main objective is to implement the *GPU Merge Path Algorithm* described in the article given below. This method will be compared with a baseline sequential algorithm.

A GoogleCollab notebook (written in French) will allow you to run the codes if you do not have a GPU environment. Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12GxUJzvWH4Tk5hpotAoxhz9cT58jUHHq?usp=sharing)
